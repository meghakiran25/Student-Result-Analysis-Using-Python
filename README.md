# Student Performance Analysis

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to analyze student performance data to understand the impact of various factors such as gender, parental education, and marital status on students' scores in math, reading, and writing.

**Methodology**

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using pandas.
Inspected the dataset for basic statistics and data types.
Checked for and handled missing values.
Removed unnecessary columns. 

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the gender distribution of students using a count plot.
Analyzed the relationship between parents' education levels and students' scores using grouped bar plots and heatmaps.
Investigated the impact of parents' marital status on students' scores with similar visualizations.
Plotted boxplots to understand the distribution of scores in math, reading, and writing.
Examined the distribution of students' ethnic groups using a pie chart.

**Insights**

1. Visualized the gender distribution to understand the balance between male and female students.

2. Grouped data by parents' education levels to calculate the mean scores in math, reading, and writing.
Found correlations between higher parental education levels and better student performance.

3. Grouped data by parents' marital status and analyzed the mean scores.
Observed trends showing how different marital statuses impact student performance.

4. Boxplots for math, reading, and writing scores helped identify the range and outliers in the data.

5. Pie chart of ethnic group distribution provided an overview of the ethnic diversity among students.ective of this project is to analyze student performance data to understand the impact of various factors such as gender, parental education, and marital status on students' scores.
