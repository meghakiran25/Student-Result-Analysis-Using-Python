# Student Performance Analysis

**Objective**

The project aims to ex# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to assist an organization in enhancing employee performance and retention (reducing attrition) through the development of an HR Analytics dashboard.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on employees including demographics, job roles, salaries, tenure, and attrition status.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of various features and their relationship with attrition.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to identify key trends and patterns in the data using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
5. **Insights Extraction**: Analyzed the visualizations to derive actionable insights that can help in reducing attrition and improving employee satisfaction.

## Insights

1. Employees with educational qualifications in Life Sciences mostly left the organization.
2. The highest attrition is in the age group 26-35 years, with 116 employees leaving.
3. Employees with a salary up to Rs. 5000 have the highest attrition, with 163 employees leaving.
4. Employees mostly leave after 1 year of service.
5. The top 4 job roles with the highest attrition rates are Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Sales Representative.

## Conclusion

To reduce attrition, the organization should implement targeted career development and mentorship programs for Life Sciences graduates, adjust salaries to be more competitive, and enhance the onboarding process to improve the first-year experience. Additionally, providing flexible work options and specialized training for high-attrition roles will address key areas of employee dissatisfaction. These measures will help retain talent, particularly among vulnerable age groups and specific job roles.
